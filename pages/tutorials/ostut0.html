			<h1>OS Tutorial 0: Setting up your environment<span class="nl"></span></h1>
			<p> 
				Developing a operating system requires a special set of tools that can make development much easier. Everything from the OS developed on, to the compiler used can affect the difficulty of development, and so for the easiest development path, the following practices should be followed.

				<h2>Host operating system</h2>
				<p>
					Although a operating system can be developed on Windows, macOS, and Linux/UNIX like OSes, Linux based operating systems dramatically ease the process for a few reasons. Firstly, Windows and macOS have a different set of common libraries than standard Linux. This point may be obvious for Windows, but even on macOS, Apple has changed some default libraries, such as the default libraries used to compile GCC, thus to develop a Linux like OS on these operating systems, the standard Linux libraries must be seperately installed. Along with this, GCC must be set up for cross compiling. This is required to compile target executeables that are not the same as the system being developed on. There are many more changes that must be made, and hence, it is simply easier to develop on a Linux machine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The easiest solution is to install VirtualBox and install your favorite Linux based operating system as a virtual machine. All SIGOPS tutorials will be written using Ubuntu 16.10, so commands may have to be changed to fit different package managers and OS specific utilities.

				<h2>Required Applications</h2>
				<p>
					We will be using a specific set of applications in our OS development tutorials. Many of these have alternatives, so feel free to substitute them for your favorite tool, but all SIGOPS tutorials will be using this set:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>build-essential
						<ul>
							<li>Common libraries used for compilaton</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>nasm
						<ul>
							<li>Assembly compiler</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>genisoimage
						<ul>
							<li>Used to create a ISO image</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>bochs
						<ul>
							<li>Powerful emulator used to run our OS</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>bochs-sdl
						<ul>
							<li>Visual addon for Bochs</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To install these on Ubuntu, simply run:
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>
sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm genisoimage bochs bochs-sdl --fix-missing
					</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					In addition to this, install your favorite text editor and get ready for development.

				<h2>Other Reccomendations</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It is generally reccomended to develop in a VM even if you are already running Linux. It provides a clean slate to development and ensures that there is nothing on your system that can conflict with your development.</li>
						<li>Put your work in a Git, or your favorite version control system, repository so that your work is saved in a secondary location. You might end up writing code that will delete your work! Losing your work can be really irritating, but with VCS, you can always revert your work.</li>
					</ul>
